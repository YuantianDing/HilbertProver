# Hilbert Prover

An Automatic Theorem Prover for Hilbert System, generating nearly-minimal proofs.

[test_results.pdf](https://github.com/YuantianDing/HibertProver/blob/master/test_results.pdf) shows the example proofs generated by HilbertProver.

## Build the Project

### Install SBT

SBT is required to build this project. You can install it from [Installing sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Setup.html)

### Compile and Run

```sh
$ sbt "run"
```

## Usage

To prove a simple theorm, just code:

```scala
package prover.test

import prover.expr._
import prover.core._

object MyTest extends App {
    import prover.core.|-._

    val p = Atom("p")
    |- (p -> p)
}
```

This will start to prove the Theorm "p -> p".

To get full proof of the theorm, add `|-.print_proof = true` to enable printing.

You will get:

```
[info] prove for p -> p with assumption List()
[info] proved for total 5 cases
[info] the length of the proof of p -> p : 5
    1: p -> (<8> -> p)                                   [L1]
    2: p -> ((<8> -> p) -> p)                            [L1]
    3: (p -> ((<8> -> p) -> p)) -> ((p -> (<8> -> p)) -> 
    3: (p -> p))                                         [L2]
    4: (p -> (<8> -> p)) -> (p -> p)                     MP 3, 2
    5: p -> p                                            MP 4, 1
```

> Note: `<8>` means you can use any expression to replace it. (`<8>` is generated by the algorithm)
> `[L1]`, `[L2]`, `[L3]` are three axioms proposed by Jan Łukasiewicz.
> `MP a, b` representing applying Modus Ponens rule.

To change the number of character each line, just use `|-.print_length = 100` ( the default is 50)
